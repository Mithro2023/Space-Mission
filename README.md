For this project, the situation involved a major space company that was not maintaining records of its launched missions. The task was to analyze the data to determine the total number of missions, successful missions, total costs, and the success rate of rockets on their first and second attempts. Additionally, the task included identifying how many successful rockets were still active compared to those that were retired. To accomplish this, I first gathered all the relevant data and cleaned it using a spreadsheet and Power BI's Power Query. I removed any duplicate rows and blank rows and corrected any misspelled entries. Ensuring the accuracy of the data types was crucial. After cleaning the data, I transferred it to Power BI to build various visualizations, including a clustered column bar to show the success rates across different attempts, multiple cards to display total missions, successful missions, and total costs, and a line chart to depict mission trends over the years. I also created a pie chart to illustrate the proportion of rockets still in service compared to those retired.
